# digidex – a digital rolodex

**A contemporary interpretation of a [rolodex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex).**

> When I started working for a newly elected member of the swiss parliament, I realized that her e-mail inbox, her DMs on Instagram, Telegram and other platforms and all the people who wanted to talk to her could soon be overwhelming. Common CRM (where the C stands for costumer or constituent, [depending on who you ask](https://civicrm.org/)) solutions were most likely overkill, since most also included features like mobilization, fundraising etc. I just wanted to find a solution, how I could easily organize, find and manage contacts, conversations, notes and whatnot in a single place. Something like «google contacts», but with certain features that would make my life easier (and put the fear that I was forgetting something at ease). That made me think of a [rolodex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex): What if we combined the simplicity of a rolodex with the power of digital conversation? Digidex is the product of these thoughts.
